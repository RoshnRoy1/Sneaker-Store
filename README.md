# E-Commerce Product Selection & Cart System

## Overview
This project is a basic e-commerce web interface that allows users to select products, view them in a slider, choose their desired color and size, add items to the cart, and proceed with checkout. The cart is dynamically updated, and users can adjust the quantity of items in the cart or remove them. A sidebar is used to display the cart, and an inactivity timer automatically closes the sidebar after 5 seconds of inactivity.

## Features

- **Product Slider**: Users can navigate through different products using a slider.
- **Product Customization**: Users can choose the color and size of products, with the corresponding image changing dynamically based on their selection.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add products to the cart, change quantities, or remove items.
- **Sidebar Cart**: The cart is displayed in a sidebar, which can be opened from both a cart button and a cart icon.
- **Inactivity Timer**: The sidebar automatically closes after 5 seconds of user inactivity.
- **Checkout**: Users can click the checkout button to simulate a checkout process, where they are directed to a payment section.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the product display, cart sidebar, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic interaction such as updating the cart, product selection, and handling events like adding/removing items.
- **DOM Manipulation**: To dynamically update the product and cart UI based on user actions.
- **Event Handling**: To manage user interactions like clicks and selections.
